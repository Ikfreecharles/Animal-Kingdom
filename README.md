# Animal-Kingdom

A base class Kingdom created.
Then 3 subclasses inheriting from the base class also created: Mammal, Insect, Amphibian. More classes can be created.

#Issue
In the class Kingdom, the ArrayList<String> food is not properly looped. This is on line 34-36. I am trying to make the items in the array appear on one line and separated by a comma.

Finally, a class Habitiat was created which can be expanded in the future. 

#NewClass Added
I added the new class InternalAttributes because:
1. It covers the internal attributes of the animals while the kingdom covers the external attributes.
2. The constructor of the class Kingdom was getting too long.
